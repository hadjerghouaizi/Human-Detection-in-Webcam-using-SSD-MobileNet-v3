The model is based on the MobileNet SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) architecture with the MobileNetV3 backbone.
It has been trained to detect objects in real-time, specifically focusing on detecting persons within a webcam feed.
The MobileNetV3 architecture is known for its efficiency and effectiveness in real-time applications, making it suitable for deployment on devices with limited computational resources.

The model is pre-trained on the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, which includes various object classes, including persons.
By leveraging transfer learning, the model has been fine-tuned to specialize in detecting persons with high accuracy and efficiency.

"ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_14.pbtxt":

This file contains the model architecture configuration in a human-readable format.
It describes the structure of the neural network, including the layers, connections, and parameters. 
The architecture file typically specifies details like layer types, input/output dimensions, and activation functions. 
In this case, it likely describes the architecture of the MobileNetV3 model, specifically configured for object detection tasks on the COCO dataset.

"frozen_inference_graph.pb":

This file contains the actual trained model parameters or weights. 
It represents the learned knowledge of the model after being trained on a specific dataset. 
The term "frozen" indicates that the model's parameters are fixed and ready for inference, meaning they won't be updated during inference time. 
This file is typically generated after training and freezing the model, allowing it to be deployed and used for making predictions on new data without further training.
